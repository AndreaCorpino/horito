Some guys (at TU Wien) wrote a Linux tool for the MikroElektronika AVRprog2
programming hardware. These guys rock, because that programmer is on my AVR
64 pin Card for the UNI-DS 3 development board. Not only does this software
let me use the board on my favorite operating system, but it also means I
don't need a license key for the mikroC IDE to develop > 2Kb hex file
programs. See http://avrprog2.sourceforge.net/
